### Topics: ###

* The nature of computers and code, what they can and cannot do
* How computer hardware works: chips, cpu, memory, disk
* Necessary jargon: bits, bytes, megabytes, gigabytes
* How software works: what is a program, what is "running"
* How digital images work
* Computer code: loops and logic
* Big ideas: abstraction, logic, bugs
* How structured data works
* How the internet works: ip address, routing, ethernet, wi-fi
* Computer security: viruses, trojans, and passwords, oh my!
* Analog vs. digital
* Digital media, images, sounds, video, compression
* CS101 coding: Javascript + some CS101 specific features
    * Not the whole Javascript language, just bits
    * Just enough code to experiment with key ideas


### Code Writing: ###

** 1. First Code Example - Print **

* print is a function -- like a verb in the code
* Numbers within the parenthesis ( ... ) are passed in to the print function
* Multiple values separated by commas
* Syntax the code is not free form
   *Syntax of the code is very limited and strict
   *A reflection of the inner, mechanical/dumb nature of the computer 
   
** 2. Print String **
